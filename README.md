# Embedded-Software-Architechture
This repository serves as a project for learning embedded software architecture from zero. The goal of the project is to finally build an architecture that can be used in real-world.

These are the skillset that you will master by the end of the project
## Core Skillsets
* Embedded Systems Expertise
  * Bare-metal or low-RTOS environments
  * MCU platforms (e.g., Arm Cortex-M family)
  * resource-constrained systems (performance, memory, and real-time constraints)
* Low-Level Programming
  * C programming
  * linker scripts and build toolchains
  * Low-level debugging (e.g., JTAG/SWD, memory analysis)
* System Architecture
  * Designing and implementing architectures for modular, upgradeable embedded software
  * Experience with memory management, sandboxing, runtime models
  * Knowledge of deterministic behaviour in embedded systems

## Security & Architecture Focus
* Secure Firmware Design
  * Secure boot processes
  * Attestation mechanism
  * Update management for secure lifecycle
  * Memory isolation and privilege seperation
* Hardware Security Features
  * Memory Protection Units (MPUs)
  * ARM TrustZone
  * CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions)
  * Virtualization techniques for MCUs
* Interface Design
  * Defining standards for loading, isolating, and interacting with Microservices
  * API/SDK design for secure services and peripheral abstraction


Bonus skills
* security models such as TrustZone, CHERI or virtualization techniques on MCUs
* creating SDKs or APIs that abstract secure services or peripheral access
