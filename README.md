# Embedded-Software-Architechture
This repository serves as a project for learning embedded software architecture from zero. The goal of the project is to finally build an architecture that can be used in real-world.

Requirements:
* embedded systems, particularly bare-metal or low-RTOS environments
* design and implement system architecture for MCU platforms
* secure firmware architectures
* C, linker scripts, build chains and low-level debugging

Bonus skills
* security models such as TrustZone, CHERI or virtualization techniques on MCUs
* creating SDKs or APIs that abstract secure services or peripheral access
